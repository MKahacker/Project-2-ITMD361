  <h1>Poetry</h1>
  
  <h2><em>Writer's Block</em></h2>
  <p>I sat and couldn't think no more<br>
    My thoughts they walked straight out the door<br>
    And here I sat waiting for more<br>
    Staring at the paper till my eyes were soar<br>
    My notebook empty from A to Z<br>
    What could I do to rhyme with Z<br>
    I sat around and thought of me<br>
    My life and what I ought to be<br>
    Yet, the siege on my mind was unbroken<br>
    My mind was sleeping it seemed broken<br>
    I would stare at the paper and try to write<br>
    But my words seemed to be lost in flight<br>
    I waited waited and then a spark<br>
    I saw over there in the dark<br>
    Suddenly waves of ideas came to be<br>
    And my mind bloomed like the blossom tree<br>

  <h2><em>Sitting Side by Side</em></h2>
  <p>Sitting side by side<br>
      And I wouldn't have lied<br>
      If I said they were identical<br>
      Parts of the same tentical<br>
      Brick and mortar offsprings<br>
      Of the old rock minings<br>
      Sitting side by side<br>
      In the city and the countryside<br>
