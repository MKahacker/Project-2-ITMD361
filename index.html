  <h1>About Me</h1>
  
  <img src="images/tiger-pic.jpg" alt="Picture of me">
  
  <p>My name is Mahmoud Kahack, I was born in K&ouml;ln, Germany in 1997, but I was raised in Chicago, IL. My parents are originally from
      K&eacute;nitra, Morocco. I am a CS major at IIT and I am going into my Sophmore year. I am a code and history enthausist. Yea, those 
      are two completely different things but I can't help but love both. My interest in history accumulates in medieval history, 
      especially the history of the geo-political changes in medieval Europe. When it comes to programming, I am madly in love with low 
      level programing especially OS development. I am also interested in cyper security and wish to start my own security firm.</p>
  
  <p>I mostly play video games and watch TV shows (excited to start watching Archer this week) on my free time. But typically I go out on 
      weekend nights. My favorite sport would be paintball although I don't paintball as much as would like. I also enjoy swimming and 
      I am notorious for jumping into lake Michigan in mid March and April just test out if the water is warm enough to swim in, ofcourse 
      its not.</p>
