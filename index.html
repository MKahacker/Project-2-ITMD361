    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <img src="images/tiger-pic.jpg" alt="Picture of me" class="paragraph_image">
    
    <p class="paragraph_1">My name is Mahmoud Kahack, I was born in K&ouml;ln, Germany in 1997, but I was raised in Chicago, IL. My parents are originally from
        K&eacute;nitra, Morocco. I am a CS major at IIT and I am going into my Sophmore year. I am a code and history enthausist. Yea, those 
        are two completely different things but I can't help but love both. My interest in history accumulates in medieval history, 
        especially the history of the geo-political changes in medieval Europe. When it comes to programming, I am madly in love with low 
        level programing especially OS development. I am also interested in cyper security and wish to start my own security firm.</p>
    
    <p class="paragraph_1">I mostly play video games and watch TV shows (excited to start watching Archer this week) on my free time. But typically I go out on 
        weekend nights. My favorite sport would be paintball although I don't paintball as much as would like. I also enjoy swimming and 
        I am notorious for jumping into lake Michigan in mid March and April just test out if the water is warm enough to swim in, ofcourse 
        its not.</p>
